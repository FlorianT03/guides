.. note::
    .. code-block::

        Whitespace, newlines, blank lines, and all kinds of markup
          (like *this* or \this) is preserved by literal blocks.
      Lookie here, I've dropped an indentation level
      (but not far enough)

    This is outside the code-block inside the admonition.
