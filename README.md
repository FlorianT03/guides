# Guides

> **EXPERIMENTAL**: This library is still under heavy development, and should be considered a work in progress project. It is subject to change or removal without notice, including without consideration for backward compatibility.

phpDocumentor's Guides library is a framework designed to take hand-written documentation in code repositories and
create an AST (abstract syntax tree) from it. This AST is then fed to a renderer, which produces the desired output. 
The Guides library is flexible, allowing you to plug in support for various input formats,
such as Restructured Text, and output formats, such as HTML.
